Since starting my web development studies about a month ago I keep finding myself needing a place to aggregate some general notes about what I've been doing/what I've learned so far.

[![Trello Board](/images/2015/06/trello.png)](/images/2015/06/trello.png)

My [Trello board][board-url] has been really great as a to-do list of what courses, sites, and resources I've come across and completed but it's not really built for reflection.  I've been keeping some notes, locally, in text format along with notes I take while going through a course, but I'm finding that gets kind of cluttered in with specific details like what Advanced Selectors are in CSS.

So here we go - the materials I'm covering are come from 3 major sources - The Odin Project, Codecademy, and Udacity:

## [The Odin Project][top-url]
TOP is a really great free, open-source curriculum made by founder of the Viking Code School.  It covers an overview of Web Development along with Ruby programming, Rails, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (and jQuery).

The curriculum is more of a guide than a course.  It's great as a basic overview of each topic and a gateway to other sources that have more focused approaches on each particular topic.  For example, to introduce a particular language TOP points me towards the relevant Codecademy course.  TOP also has a lot of project assignments for learning by doing.

## [Codecademy][ca-url]
CA is a free, interactive site that teaches you the fundamentals of a coding/programming language.  It covers less of the install, setup, etc. and lets you get right into learning syntax, language constructs, and usage.  All your work and learning is done right through the browser window and CA also tracks your progress as you go through each section.

While there isn't much in terms of scope (best practices, how developers use this language in the real world) overall, CA basic, but definitely useful, beginner level resource.

## [Udacity][ud-url]
If CA is for beginners UD sort of bridges the gap between basic knowledge and novice or intermediate-level understanding.  I've only taken a few of the (free) courses but UD sort of assumes you have a basic background (not for absolute beginners who are starting from 0).

UD courses are great for conceptual learning and understanding.  It goes beyond do X to get Y and takes the time to explain the concepts behind *why* X does Y.
