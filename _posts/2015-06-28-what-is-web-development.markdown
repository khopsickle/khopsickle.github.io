My first experiences with web development were a little over 10 years ago. In high school I was creating custom themes and static pages for personal blogs for myself and friends. This was back when most layouts were still structured by tables so, of course, I've missed a lot since then and need to update what I did know as well as pick up new stuff.

I was doing the UD intro course on HTML and CSS when I realized it wasn't just HTML5 semantics tags I needed to learn. My knowledge of how the web works was pretty basic. From my computer science courses in college I was familiar with command line and what client, server, and FTP meant and how to generally use them, but there were big gaps in my knowledge.

To prep for diving deeper into web development (and also because I figured having the basics down would allow me to practice them as I study) I found this set of videos from LearnCode especially useful:

## LearnCode - [Must-Know Technologies for Web Developers][learncode-url]

This video is a basic walk through of web development technologies and languages and where they sort of fall on the front-end to back-end spectrum. Particularly helpful because it uses a [Coggle mind map][coggle-url] to illustrate things and includes links to videos explaining each particular concept.

I found the Client &amp; Server videos especially useful, but the Terminal/Command Line, SSH, and GitHub ones were a little too basic.  Git/GitHub especially, because using version control is new to me and a little more complex than entering commands in Terminal.

The good news is It's a lot easier to fill the gaps today than it used to be. There are tons of online courses, YouTube tutorials, blog resources, q&amp;a boards (StackOverflow), and even bootcamps.  I already knew this, but it doesn't hurt to say it again - Google is my friend.

## TOP - [Chapter 1: Intro to Web Development][top-ch1]

Chapter 1 does a quick intro to Web Development and the course itself similar to LearnCode's video.  It's a quick read and also introduces web development communities which is pretty useful, but I still liked the LearnCode video.

## UD - [Git &amp; GitHub][ud-git]

As a supplement I went through the UD course on Git and GitHub.  This course breaks everything down and explains it conceptually while also giving you follow-along assignments.

## TOP - [Chapter 2: Web Development 101][top-ch2] (One Section)

This section of Web Development 101 on TOP also does a good job of better covering some of these topics.  But because of it's location late in the chapter I came across the LearnCode video and UD lesson first.
