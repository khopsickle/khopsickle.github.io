TOP is a fantastic resource for project ideas as a beginner - mostly these are clones of existing sites, but it gives you something to do, shows you other student examples (in case you get stuck), and fully embraces the idea of "learn by doing."  However, I think the exercises can be a little time consuming and daunting for HTML and CSS newbies.

I would've struggled a lot more if I hadn't done the UD course and seen modular CSS in practice.  Shay Howe has some good tips for best practices but glosses over exactly how to go about creating cleaner, reusable CSS architecture.

Practicing CSS this way teaches bad habits - after you have a solid understanding its much more useful to learn best practices and professional standards *then* putting them into practice in the assignments.  After the third project I completed Chapter 5, skipping the assignments, then moved on to other sources for advanced CSS, and finally went back to do the projects armed with more powerful tools and strategies for coding HTML and CSS.

I'm also going back to those first projects to refactor (reorganize, rewrite) them, so that's a possible extra step to add at the end of Chapter 5.
